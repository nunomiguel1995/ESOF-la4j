##Process View <a name="PV"></a>
To provide a basis for understanding the process organization of the system, an architectural view called the process view is used in the Analysis & Design discipline. There is only one process view of the system, which illustrates the process decomposition of the system, including the mapping of classes and subsystems on to processes and threads.

DEFINITION - The process view deals with the dynamic aspects of the system, explains the system
processes and how they communicate, and focuses on the runtime behavior of the system.
The process view addresses concurrency, distribution, integrators, performance,and 
scalability, etc. UML diagrams to represent process view include the activity diagram.
