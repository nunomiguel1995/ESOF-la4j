##Software maintainability  <a name="Maint"></a>

|SIG metric 	| Description
|---	        |---	
|Write short units of code 	  |  small units are easy to understand, easy to test and easy to reuse	
|Write simple units of code   |  keeping the number of branch points low makes units easier to modify and test	
|Write code once              |copied code makes that bugs need to be fixed at multiple places, which is inefficient and error-prone
|Keep unit interfaces small   |  keeping the number of parameters low makes units easier to understand and reuse 	
|Separate concerns in modules | changes in a loosely coupled codebase are much easier to oversee and execute than changes in a tightly coupled code‐ base	
|Couple architecture components loosely  	| isolated maintenance it’s easier with independent components
|Keep architecture components balanced 	  |   	balanced components makes it easier to locate code and allow for isolated maintenance
|Keep your codebase small  	  |   	keeping product, project and team size small is a crucial point for a successful software
|Automate tests             	| automated testing makes development foreseeable and less dangerous
|Write clean code             |clean code makes a maintainable software
